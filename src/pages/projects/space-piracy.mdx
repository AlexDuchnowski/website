I created the Space Piracy puzzle for the [2023 Brown Puzzle Hunt](https://2023.brownpuzzlehunt.com). The puzzle was designed for the final round of the hunt, so it is meant to take more than a few minutes to solve (and it could in fact take significantly longer).

As with all puzzles in a puzzle hunt, the "solution" to the puzzle is a word or phrase. A (slightly modified) copy of the puzzle is provided below:

<div class="piracy" style="font-family: Cascadia Code;">
    <br />
    <header>
        <h4>
            <i>To hack the space station, you'll need more fingers than the average astronaut and familiarity with the crew's favorite functions.</i>
        </h4>
    </header>
    <br />
    <center>
        <input
            type="text"
            id="guess"
            placeholder="ENTER NUMBER HERE"
            size="20"
            style="text-transform: uppercase;font-size: large;border: 2px solid black;"
        />
        <br />
        <br />
        <div id="response-container" style="overflow-x: auto;white-space: nowrap;scrollbar-width: auto;"></div>
    </center>
    <br />
</div>
