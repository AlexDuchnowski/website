I would like to thank my friend [Richard Fu](https://www.richardfxr.com/), who not only helped me select an appropriate framework for coding this website but also walked me through setting it up and getting it to work. I used the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework, and I got a lot of inspiration from the [Zaggonaut theme](https://zaggonaut.dev/).

I am no expert in web development, but with some knowledge of HTML acquired through web scraping, some experience with Typescript from software engineering coursework and my development of the <a href="/projects/space-piracy">Space Piracy puzzle</a>, and the occasional tip from an LLM, I was able to create this website. I hope to continue to improve it over time with help and feedback from others.
