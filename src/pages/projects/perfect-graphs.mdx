The final project for my Graph Theory course was to create a video explaining a graph theory concept. My partner and I chose to explain [perfect graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_graph).

Having grown up watching math videos from channels like [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown), [Vi Hart](https://vimeo.com/vihart), and [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile), I wanted to create a video that was engaging and visually appealing. I discovered that 3Blue1Brown had a public animation library called [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) and that there was a [community edition](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) with [documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.mobject.graph.Graph.html#manim.mobject.graph.Graph) for animating graphs.

With this tool, I was able to create scenes using Python code like the following, which creates the final scene of the video:

```python
class Threshold(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        G = Graph([], [])
        self.add(G)
        self.play(G.animate.add_vertices(1, labels=True, positions={1: [-2, -2, 0]}))
        self.wait(3)
        self.play(G.animate.add_vertices(2, labels=True, positions={2: [0, -2, 0]}))
        self.wait(3)
        self.play(G.animate.add_vertices(3, labels=True, positions={3: [0, 0, 0]}))
        self.play(G.animate.add_edges(*[(3, v) for v in range(1, 3)]))
        self.wait(5)
        ...
```

This, along with a few helper functions for procedurally creating common types of graphs, made it easy to create clean animations that conveyed the concepts we wanted to explain.

After collecting and organizing a set of concepts and fun facts surrounding perfect graphs, we determined the structure of the video with a storyboard.

We were then able to create the following video. Please note that some background in graph theory is assumed, as our intended audience was our classmates.
