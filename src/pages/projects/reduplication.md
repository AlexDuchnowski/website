description: An analysis of the uses of reduplication in movie dialogues.
---

As our final project for our Computational Linguistics course, my group decided to analyze the use of reduplication (a linguistic phenomenon where a word is repeated) in movie dialogues. Using a combination of bash scripting, manual annotation, and R programming, we analyzed several hundred examples of reduplication in movies. For a full writeup of our project, please go to <a href="/projects/reduplication-writeup">this link</a>.
